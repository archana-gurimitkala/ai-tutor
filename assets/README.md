# Assets Folder

This folder contains visual assets for the README, such as:
- `colab_demo_output.png` or `colab_demo_output.gif` - Screenshot/GIF of a Colab Q&A session

## How to Capture Colab Output:

1. Open the Colab notebook and run a sample Q&A
2. Take a screenshot or record a GIF of the cells with outputs
3. Save it here as `colab_demo_output.png` (or `.gif`)
4. Commit and push to GitHub

The image will automatically appear in the main README.md.
